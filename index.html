            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, Iâ€™m Ashutosh Bhatt â€” a Computer Science undergraduate at NIT Uttarakhand, passionate about problem-solving, technology, and building a future that goes beyond my beginnings.
            </p>
            <p>
                I come from a small village in Tehri Garhwal, and my journey so far is a reflection of grit, consistency, and dreams that refuse to stay small. From overcoming early hurdles with language & academics, to securing a place at NIT and now aiming for top tech roles, Iâ€™ve always believed in growing step by step.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m deeply invested in Data Structures & Algorithms, with over <strong>350+ problems</strong> solved across platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and CodeChef. I actively participate in contests, aiming to sharpen my thinking for challenges like ICPC, Flipkart Grid, and eventually, Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, Iâ€™m diving into full-stack development, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€” and excited to bring real projects to life. My vision is to blend strong core tech skills with practical development, to build products that solve real problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring the latest in tech, reading about AI and machine learning, or engaging with the community to help others on their paths. I believe in the power of collaboration and sharing knowledge, which is why Iâ€™m always open to mentoring and learning from peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of code, youâ€™ll often find me pondering how galaxies work, reflecting on lifeâ€™s meaning, or helping peers chart their own journeys.
            </p>
            <p>
                ðŸš€ <strong>Tech stack & interests:</strong>
            </p>
